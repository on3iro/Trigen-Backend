# passCreator-Backend

[Frontend](https://github.com/on3iro/passCreator-Frontend)

## UPDATE 28.06.2017
* This project is currently stale as its main purpose (university grade) has been fulfilled
* I might rewrite this just for fun in the future (if I can find some spare time)

This is the backend for the Trigen password generator, a university projekt and work in progress. At this point it is known to have some security holes and should not yet be used in a productive setting.

## installation for development purposes

* ```git clone``` repo
* ```cd``` into repo
* ```virtualenv ./```
* ```source bin/activate```
* ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Now you can run the app with ```python app/triserv.py```

The Api should be available at ```127.0.0.1:5000```.
